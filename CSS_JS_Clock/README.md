## My process

### Built with

- Vallila JS
- CSS


### What I learned

In this project, I learned more about DOM manipulation. Also learned more about the Date() object and its different properties, i.e. getSeconds, getMinutes.
Here is a snippet of code I'm proud of:

```javascript
//These 3 lines of code rotate the hands on the clock based on a formula created to get the degrees => for example, ((seconds/60) * 360) + 90
secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg)`;
minuteHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minutesDegrees}deg)`;
hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hoursDegrees}deg)`;
```

### Continued development

Currently going through different JS coding challenges with Codesmith to ensure that my skillset is continuously growing. Also looking forward to completing this 30 day challenge.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Great resource for developers. Has documentation for JS, HTML, CSS, etc.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Great resource if ever you get stuck with your code.
